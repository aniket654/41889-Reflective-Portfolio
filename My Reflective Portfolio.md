# 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

Upon reflection, I have realised that this week was tough for me. Coming back from holidays and suddenly having to sit through a three-hour workshop was difficult, as there was a lot to process. Although in saying this, I have learnt many aspects of what a “system” is and how hard it is to define it. Thus there are many aspects of what comprises a system. A system must have multiple elements or parts, these elements and parts must have a vital relationship with each other and a system must perform a function. I have also learnt about the distinct boundaries of systems, such as open systems, closed systems as well as isolated systems. I have also learnt what makes a complex system and that they show self-organisation and emergence. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Everything that was introduced in the workshop was seemingly new to me. I had thought of some the aspects of what a system is but never really had a clear definition of what makes a system in my head. Thus, it was really interesting to listen to what the professors were talking about.

### What insights have I gained?
I was finally able to understand what a system is and that there are multiple variants of systems. Being an individual interested in information technology I had always thought of how technologies such as phone and computers are fundamental in today’s society. The notion that these technologies are comprised of elements such as processors, ram, motherboards etc. is an obvious thought, yet to be able to classify them as systems and look at it from a holistic standpoint was a new perspective for me which I am able to appreciate and I have thus gained insight about this.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength of mine that I have noted by reflection is that I am able to understand the material shown so far by relating it to my experiences. I am able to clearly understand what a complex adaptive system is as I can imagine complex systems such as traffic flows adapting to the surrounding situation. A weakness that I have observed is my inability to sit through a 3-hour workshop without having spans of focus loss and “zoning out” this is a weakness I would pin on the lack of holidays and suddenly having to get back into the right frame of mind in order to work.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges I have encountered is the retention of material. This is due to three hours worth of material being shown at once. Although I was able to understand and remember the majority of the material, some of it was more difficult to comprehend. Thus, I handled this by making notes of the material and revising over them until I understood and remembered it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would better listen and focus on the material presented in order to maximise my comprehension and retention of the resources. This would allow me to more efficiently manage my time and effort.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Going into class, I had a theory that I could maximise this semester’s results by being organised with my notes and assignment dates from day one. I hypothesize this theory will be useful, and I am happy that I am able to follow this so far. I have learnt that this semester will be hard work, but it is hard work that I am willing to do.

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt about the many-models thinking approach and how it can improve efficiency within various aspects of life and the workforce as well.I ahve also learnt that models make us better thinkers as it allows us to visualise the vast amounts of data we can recieve.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that I have always used the many-models thinking approach without even realising it. I have used it in my past work experience in the warehouse of a bookstore. I used the model given to me by my manager and organised the books using the thinking approach. This approach helped me think clearer and organise many books in a limited amount of time.

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights that I have gained include:
Models make us clear thinkers
Models help us strategise and design
Models also help us predict future results and give us a pattern to large amounts of data

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From last week, I noted that a strength of mine is that I am able to understand the material shown so far by relating it to my experiences. This has continued to be the case and I am on top of my notes and work so far, I able able to conceptualise the many-models approach by relating it to my work experience. The weakness from last week that I observed is my inability to sit through a 3-hour workshop without having spans of focus loss I would say that I still experience this weakness but the breaks within the workshop certainly helps. Another weakness is that I found it hard to ask random people if they wanted to be in my group, altough I got over this by just doing it without thinking too much, which also helped.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
What I said last week still stands the retention of material is a challenge which was quite difficult. I still handled this by making notes of the material as well as flash cards in order to comprehend them. Thus I would say I handled it well.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would use my flash cards that I have made to practise active learning instead of just passive reading. This method of recalling information is well studied and documented to a more efficient way of studying. Thus, the anticipated results are a higher rate of memory retention of the subject material.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
My theory that I could maximise this semester’s results by being organised with my notes and assignment dates from day one is still in play and working well. I hypothesize this theory will be useful, and will pay dividends at the end of the semester by achieving good results. I have learnt that it will be more tough than I anticipated due to having to do it for four subjects but I believe I can get through it.
