# 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

Upon reflection, I have realised that this week was tough for me. Coming back from holidays and suddenly having to sit through a three-hour workshop was difficult, as there was a lot to process. Although in saying this, I have learnt many aspects of what a “system” is and how hard it is to define it. Thus there are many aspects of what comprises a system. A system must have multiple elements or parts, these elements and parts must have a vital relationship with each other and a system must perform a function. I have also learnt about the distinct boundaries of systems, such as open systems, closed systems as well as isolated systems. I have also learnt what makes a complex system and that they show self-organisation and emergence. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Everything that was introduced in the workshop was seemingly new to me. I had thought of some the aspects of what a system is but never really had a clear definition of what makes a system in my head. Thus, it was really interesting to listen to what the professors were talking about.

### What insights have I gained?
I was finally able to understand what a system is and that there are multiple variants of systems. Being an individual interested in information technology I had always thought of how technologies such as phone and computers are fundamental in today’s society. The notion that these technologies are comprised of elements such as processors, ram, motherboards etc. is an obvious thought, yet to be able to classify them as systems and look at it from a holistic standpoint was a new perspective for me which I am able to appreciate and I have thus gained insight about this.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength of mine that I have noted by reflection is that I am able to understand the material shown so far by relating it to my experiences. I am able to clearly understand what a complex adaptive system is as I can imagine complex systems such as traffic flows adapting to the surrounding situation. A weakness that I have observed is my inability to sit through a 3-hour workshop without having spans of focus loss and “zoning out” this is a weakness I would pin on the holidays and suddenly having to get back into the right frame of mind in order to work.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges I have encountered is the retention of material. This is due to three hours worth of material being shown at once. Although I was able to understand and remember the majority of the material, some of it was more difficult to comprehend. Thus, I handled this by making notes of the material and revising over them until I understood and remembered it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would better listen and focus on the material presented in order to maximise my comprehension and retention of the resources. This would allow me to more efficiently manage my time and effort.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Going into class, I had a theory that I could maximise this semester’s results by being organised with my notes and assignment dates from day one. I hypothesize this theory will be useful, and I am happy that I am able to follow this so far. I have learnt that this semester will be hard work, but it is hard work that I am willing to do.

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about the many-models thinking approach and how it can improve efficiency within various aspects of life and the workforce as well. I have also learnt that models make us better thinkers as it allows us to visualise the vast amounts of data we can recieve.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that I have always used the many-models thinking approach without even realising it. I have used it in my past work experience in the warehouse of a bookstore. I used the model given to me by my manager and organised the books using the thinking approach. This approach helped me think clearer and organise many books in a limited amount of time.

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights that I have gained include:
Models make us clear thinkers
Models help us strategise and design
Models also help us predict future results and give us a pattern to large amounts of data

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From last week, I noted that a strength of mine is that I am able to understand the material shown so far by relating it to my experiences. This has continued to be the case and I am on top of my notes and work so far, I able able to conceptualise the many-models approach by relating it to my work experience. The weakness from last week that I observed is my inability to sit through a 3-hour workshop without having spans of focus loss I would say that I still experience this weakness but the breaks within the workshop certainly helps. Another weakness is that I found it hard to ask random people if they wanted to be in my group, altough I got over this by just doing it without thinking too much, which also helped.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
What I said last week still stands the retention of material is a challenge which was quite difficult. I still handled this by making notes of the material as well as flash cards in order to comprehend them. Thus I would say I handled it well.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would use my flash cards that I have made to practise active learning instead of just passive reading. This method of recalling information is well studied and documented to a more efficient way of studying. Thus, the anticipated results are a higher rate of memory retention of the subject material.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
My theory that I could maximise this semester’s results by being organised with my notes and assignment dates from day one is still in play and working well. I hypothesize this theory will be useful, and will pay dividends at the end of the semester by achieving good results. I have learnt that it will be more tough than I anticipated due to having to do it for four subjects but I believe I can get through it.

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
During the course of this week, I have learnt about different models of thinking such as the rational model, behaviorial model and rule-based models. I learnt the different aspects of these models and how they correlate with different scenarios as they all have advantages and disadvantages to them.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I have now realised that I usually think in a combination of rational and behaviorial models. I am rational with my money and investments as I want to save and grow whatever wealth I have now, and I am behavioural in scenarios such as going on YouTube when I know that I should be doing work. I also know how these models work and correlate with business decisions as a business may need to change their model depending on what the situation is.

### What insights have I gained?
Some insights that I have gained include:
Rational and behavioural models correlate with everyday life 
There are different models for different scenarios, no "one model fits all" approach

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A perceived strength that I have observed from past weeks in that I can understand course material by relating it to my past experiences. I was able to do that to an even greater extent this week as I correlated rational and behavioural models to my everyday life. Another strength that I have observed is my ability to conduct further research in my coursework in order to increase my knowledge. A weakness of mine is that I get distracted easily when doing work in general and suffer from the common problem of procrastination. I have very little idea on how to combat this and will research possible solutions to this problem.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Retention of material was still a challenge but was much easier this time around, I handled the problem by making flash cards and going through them every second day or so.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would continue to use my flash cards that I have made to practise active learning. The results of this should add up every week as I should be able to hold more course material through practice.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that I had at the start of the semester was that I could maximise this semester’s results by being organised with my notes. I hypothesize this theory will be extremely useful, and I could achieve relatively good results by doing this. I have learnt that it will be less tough and more consistency as my retention is undeniably improving. 

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about system dynamics and network basics. More specifically, the structure of various networks such as centralised, decentralised and distributed as well as the different logic of networks.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I have realised the importance of feedback through the causal loop diagrams. This has greatly improved my understanding of a system. The causal loop diagram can be shown and explained to anyone as it can graph the natural flow of information and identify any errors or hindrances.

### What insights have I gained?
A major insight I gained this week was due to the video played in the tutorial which effectively highlighted that the current method of modelling Covid-19 is practically ineffective. This video highlighted that agent-based models are a more effective response when dealing with a real-world issue which has various autonomous agents. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived strength continues to be understanding course material by relating it to my past experiences. This was a bit more difficult this week as some concept were a bit more arbitrary, although I feel as though I was still able to retain information effectively. A weakness of mine which I observed is that I get distracted easily when doing work in general and suffer from the common problem of procrastination. I have done research on this topic and am now effectively studying using the Pomodoro technique.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I used my flashcards in order to practice retention of information this week as well. It was more of a challenge due to some arbitrary concepts although it was done well. Another challenge was learning the basics of Python again. I had learnt Python before but hadn’t used it in a long time and had forgotten most of it. Thus, the revision of the language was refreshing.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would continue to use the flashcards that I have made to practise active learning. This should result in a compounding of knowledge throughout the semester. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of agent-based models was very interesting this week. It was useful as it demonstrated the inadequacies of the current Covid-19 modelling and how it will need to be adapted in the future.

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about aggregating decisions and behaviour. The content learnt this week was based around predicting patterns and behaviour and how to model them. In other words, using logic and algorithms to predict human behaviour in the future based on the past.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that human decisions can be modelled using statistics. I also do the “Business Statistics” course which overlapped a lot of the material presented this week such as long-tailed distribution and the addition law. I learnt the use of applying statistics to real-world situations to predict behaviour and future movement.

### What insights have I gained?
A major insight I gained this week was due to the TED talk presented in class, featuring Geoff West. This TED talk was about the use of power laws in order to predict the lifetimes of cities and businesses. He stated that every business will eventually go on and die out. Even seemingly massive corporations today such as Google, Facebook and Apple will all eventually die out.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, we created the group chat for our group and discussed potential topics, my strength was taking initiative to ask the group which topic they preferred and then having a discussion about the pros and cons for each suggested topic. A weakness this week was again getting distracted although I have implemented various techniques in order to combat this.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges that I have encountered this week is still the re-learning of Python. This is a challenge which I am willing to take as I am keen to get a good grade for this subject.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would continue to take initiative and initiate conversation within our group chat in order to start working on the assignment properly. Next time I would be more vocal in expressing my opinion and listen to suggestions from group members with an open and clear mind.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The aggregation of behaviours theory proved to be useful this week, this was due to the ability of this theory to predict accurate outcomes of agents in the future. This has various real-world implementations such as recognising potentially threatening behaviours and changing it as early as possible.

## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt mainly about Markov models and Random Walk models. Markov models are used mainly to model randomly occurring events. It can also be used to make predictions, recognise patterns and to learn the statistics of sequential data. For example, a Markov model could be used to model the number of alert students who transition to bored students. The Random Walk model is used in situations in which a path is determined from a number of random steps e.g. the stock market.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I now know that path dependence is a key factor for future outcomes. For example, the QWERTY keyboard that is used by the majority of people all around the world isn’t just randomly placed letters, instead, it is because there was a path dependence to typewriters as this sequence caused less jamming. Path dependence is a key factor to future outcomes such as economic success, technology and law.

### What insights have I gained?
The main Insight that I have gained in the workshop had to be the random walk model video. It was insightful as it gave me a clear idea of how the random walk model was structured and real-world applications for it.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived strengths this week were a continuation of last week as I began the discussion with my group about who is doing what topic for the week 8 pre-submission. Thus I feel as if I am apt at taking the initiative to commence discussion with my group when no one else would. A weakness of mine would be not fully understanding each topic this week as there were so many each with their own chunk of information, I would definitely have to revise later on in order to fully grasp the concepts.
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I have encountered included the allocation of the different tasks as well as the retention of information due to the large volume presented this week. Although I feel as though my retention is slowly but surely improving as I have prepared a study schedule to help me pace myself.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next week, I would focus on revising the material from this week in order to retain all the information, along with continuing to initiate group conversation in order to see how everyone is going with their allocated tasks in order to provide direction for the group.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Personally, I found the theory of path dependence to be useful as it shows that past decisions affect future decisions. In business, it would be important to consider this factor due in order to increase the probability of predicting the outcomes of decisions as they would be correlated to past decisions which may have been similar in nature.
 
## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I have learnt about emergent behaviours and complexity. I have gained a deep understanding of segregation and peer effects. This was done through an analysis of the Standing Ovation model, Granovetter’s Riot Model and Schelling’s Segregation Model. During the workshop, we had a discussion on how is it that certain agents interact with each other and how it is that their behaviour can be altered due to neighbouring agents.
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I am now aware of how pretty much anything can be modelled, including concepts you may not think about that often such as cultural spread. I also know how Schelling studied income segregation for developed parts of the world and how his Segregation Model, Granovetter’s model and the Standing Ovation model all include probability calculations.

### What insights have I gained?
I would say that the most significant insight that I gained during the week’s workshop was the fact that you can rewrite the segregation and riot models in order to apply them to pretty much any social situation reflecting an individuals thought process. This can be reflected in today’s society responding to the Covid-19 pandemic as if one person wears a mask it can influence someone else to as well.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength this week was that I felt as if I could apply these models to real-life situations in order to grasp a better concept of what they were and any extra applications they may have. A weakness was that I may have procrastinated a bit on the group pre-submission and need to work on it in order to present a good assignment.
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
For the assignment, I have struggled in terms of doing research on the different models of Covid. There is a lot of information being presented and it’s taking time to me to understand it, making me lose interest and therefore procrastinate. It has also been a challenge to understand the probability calculations of the different models presented in the workshop.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would try to set a schedule ad stick to it in order to limit procrastinating on the assignment. There is still time but I know I should get it done sooner. I would also try to limit the amount of information I try to take in at once and try the Pomodoro technique of studying.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The Schelling’s Segregation Model proved to be a useful piece of content this week as it helped me gain a better understanding of human behaviour and how it might be easily influenced whilst being completely oblivious to the fact that we are even being influenced.

## Week 8 - STUVAC

## Week 9

### What progress has been made in terms of the assignment?
This week I was working on assigning the remaining tasks of the assignment as well as starting to work on my individually allocated task, section 4 of the assignment. I was finding some agent-based models online but due to my limited knowledge of Python as a programming language, it was tough to make the code that I found work. I have however saved these code and plan to expand my knowledge of Python in order to get these to work.
 
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived strength this week has to be my ability to initiate conversation in the breakout room and allocate the different tasks of the assignment which were still not allocated even after the Pre-Submission. I successfully allocated the tasks based on skill and even though no one in our group really has too much experience with Python, I volunteered to do section 4 as I was the only one who had used it before and was keen to learn Python again. A weakness of mine would be to ask for help when I need it and I will work on this in the coming days.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges that I have observed this week would include getting the code that I found to work. I still haven’t solved this problem and am actively seeking methods in order to do so.

### What still needs to be done in terms of the assignment?
Everyone I believe has started on their parts, but we still need to finish our parts and combine them to form a draft of the assignment. We also need to get in touch with the tutor as we have some questions as a group that we need to ask.

## Week 10

### What progress has been made in terms of the assignment?
This week, I got the sample agent-based model code to work. As a group, we took feedback from there other group and made changes accordingly. However, only one person from the other group gave feedback, so the changes we could make were limited.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Carrying on from last week, my strength is still initiating conversation with group members. I also learnt a lot about Python in a week and have found how to fix the error that was being output in the sample code. Weaknesses this week have been spending too much time learning Python and not progressing as much as I could have with the assignment.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The major challenge this week was learning Python, it was very time consuming and at times a bit hard to understand. However with my prior knowledge of java, the programming aspect wasn’t too difficult, understanding the errors however was hard and took time to find out what they meant,

### What still needs to be done in terms of the assignment?
The majority of section 4 still needs to be completed, I also need to adapt the ABM to our groups topic of Covid-19 and complete the other two model’s code. We still need to get in contact with the tutor in order to answer some questions.

## Week 11

### What progress has been made in terms of the assignment?
This week we got in touch with the tutor and he gave some constructive feedback. He told us that the way we split the workload may have been unfair as section 4 was the largest section by far. He suggested we all work on section 4 in order to evenly split the workload and manage our time effectively, as we need to complete section 4 before moving on to any others. Thus, we still section 4 so that Ashraya and I would complete the Agent-Based Model code, and Akash and Redah would complete the Behavioural Model as well as the Colonel Blotto model. This was done as the tutor suggested that the Agent-Based Model code would be the most difficult to adapt. Thus we decided two people working on it would be the most optimal route for the assignment. We also got gifted an extension on the assignment to the 6th of November as opposed to the 23rd. This gives us around two extra weeks in order to complete the assignment, which is comforting yet it also increases the overall expectation of the finished assignment.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived strength that I have observed this week would be to really get a good grasp of Python by now and be able to translate some of my thoughts into code. A weakness would be that I was unable to accurately adapt the ABM to our group topic as of yet.
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges that I have observed this week was the splitting up of group work again. Although this took workload off me as I was originally planning to do all of section 4 myself, I now have to explain to the other group members what to do and where to learn Python from etc. This is due to the fact that many of the other group members have never used that programming language before.

### What still needs to be done in terms of the assignment?
We still need to finish section 4 of the assignment in order to move on to other parts of the assignment.

## Week 12

### What progress has been made in terms of the assignment?
This week class was cancelled due to the tutor offering to do 1 on 1 workshops instead in order to assist groups with their assignment. As a group, we have made substantial contributions to section 4 and are nearly finished at the moment. Ashraya and I have successfully completed the adaptation of the Agent-Based Model python code to our group subject and are waiting for the other two members of the group to finish their allocated tasks, which should be done soon.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived strength that I have observed this week would include my communication skills as I was able to successfully instruct the other members of the group on what they had to do, how to install Jupyter Notebook etc. I also communicated well with my partner Ashraya and we managed to complete the adaptation of the ABM code. This week I do not think I have observed a weakness as I am satisfied with my productivity and how I managed to communicate.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I have observed this week would be adapting the code to our topic. We had a group meeting where I briefed Ashraya on what we needed to do, he did research and we came up with good ideas and how to actually implement them. We successfully implemented the code after a few meetings and are proud of the challenge that we overcame.

### What still needs to be done in terms of the assignment?
In terms of the assignment, we still need to do sections 5, 6 and 7 of the assignment. This shouldn’t be too difficult as we have done the largest section of the assignment.

### How did you find the overall subject?
Overall I found this subject to be very challenging yet rewarding. The reflection portfolio clearly indicates what I’ve learnt throughout the semester. It is interesting to look back at the earlier weeks of the semester and observe the constant challenges that I have had to face. This subject overall taught me a lot and I am glad to have taken it. I now have a clearer understanding of models and how they are all around us, from laptops to complex models about the weather throughout our lives we use many models in order to understand the world around us. Thus this subject taught me to think deeply and appreciate the beautiful complexity of models and how they are used.
